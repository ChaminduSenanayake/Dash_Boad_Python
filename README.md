# Dashboard 
A dashboard is a tool used for information management and business intelligence. It provides 
an overall view of key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to a particular objective or business 
process.

# Background of the red wine data and objectives of using a dashboard
Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. There are many types of red 
wine, which vary in taste and color. Red wine has been part of social, religious, and cultural 
events for hundreds of years. Grapes are rich in many antioxidants. These antioxidants, 
especially resveratrol and proanthocyanidins, are believed to be responsible for the health 
benefits of red wine. Proanthocyanidins may reduce oxidative damage in the body. They may 
also help prevent heart disease and cancer. 
  
# Variable description
**Response variable :**  
Quality - a categorical variable (score between 0 and 10)

**Explanatory variables :**  
Fixed acidity - a quantitative variable  
Volatile acidity - a quantitative variable  
Citric acid - a quantitative variable  
Residual sugar - a quantitative variable  
Chlorides - a quantitative variable  
Free sulfur dioxide - a quantitative variable  
Total sulfur dioxide - a quantitative variable  
Density - a quantitative variable  
pH - a quantitative variable  
Sulphates - a quantitative variable  
Alcohol - a quantitative variable  

# Data preparation
There were 1599 recordings in the red wine data set. There were no missing values or duplicate 
values in the dataset. Hence it was not needed to remove records or impute the values and the 
whole dataset was used for the analysis.
The quality of the wine (Response variable) was measured using a scale of 0 to 10. When plotting 
data, there were some unclear graphs as the response variable had more categories. Hence the 
response variable was recorded into 3 categories by considering 0 to 3 as ‘Low’, 4 to 6 as 
‘Moderate’ and 7 to 10 as ‘High’ to display the graphs more clearly in the dashboard.
